      <description>Reflection on some issues I faced. If you find some of these useful, great. The post is not intended as an advice
Background Recently I heard the talk python to me podcast where A. Jesse Davis was interviewed. The topic was a bit different than usual python related topics. It was about how to make blogging easy. Jesse talks about several nice things, including the fact that why we should not feel guilty for not blogging regularly.</description>

      <description>Little bit of a histoy of my blog at various platforms.
This is my third attempt at blogging.
Wordpress.com First one is still on hosted wordpress site. In a way, that is nice. Pretty much no administration needed. One can install the plugins that are tested by wordpress.com They also upgrade the platform for you. Great for testing the waters for the first time blogger. I think it is better than blogspot (I can&#39;t remember if I had one of those, and moved to wordpress)</description>
