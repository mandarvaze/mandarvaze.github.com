      <title>2019 Review</title>

      <description>Earlier I wrote about how Jan 1st is not a special date in any way.
While I still believe that for starting something new, or changing, calendar years give us well defined time against which we measure progress (and make plans. Or is it the other way around ?)
365/366 days is well agreed upon time. So it is as good as 30 or 90 days.
While we can &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; any day and &amp;ldquo;look back&amp;rdquo; approximately 360 days later, we are more likely to do that when everyone considers starting a new year.</description>

      <description>Learning Programming Language In the review of 2016, I had written about &amp;ldquo;learning go&amp;rdquo;.
Well, that didn&#39;t happen.
But instead I picked up &amp;ldquo;elixir&amp;rdquo;. I loved it. I did several exercises from codewars.
Initially, the exercises looked too &amp;ldquo;amateurish&amp;rdquo;, but once I hit a road-block, where I was required to use recursion instead of loops, I realized that &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; exercises are important to get my head around the functional paradigm.</description>

      <description>Some of the highlights of the year gone by
Moved to spacemacs I had started experimenting with spacemacs around late 2015. In 2016, I completely switched to spacemacs. I&#39;m consciously saying spacemacs, because although it is &amp;ldquo;emacs&amp;rdquo; I am used to spacemacs keybindings, and may not be able to use &amp;ldquo;plain&amp;rdquo; emacs on any other system. (Turns out it is said that unlike vi/vim, no two emacs users can use each others system, because of heavy personal customizations.</description>
