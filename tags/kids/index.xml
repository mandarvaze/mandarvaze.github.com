      <description>Derek Sivers says
 A new year begins when thereâ€™s a memorable change in my life. Not January 1st. Nothing changes on January 1st.
 I recently started reading Austin Kleon&#39;s book Keep Going
In it he mentions that making gifts for others gives you joy.
I spent New Year Eve 2019 making these for my kids. (6 and 4 as of this writing) My spouse had to work late (work deadline) and it was just 3 of us.</description>
