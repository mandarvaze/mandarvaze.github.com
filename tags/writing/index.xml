      <description>You are a writer. (So start acting like one)
I started reading a book by Jeff Goins, with the same name as the title of this post.
In his book, he compares his relationship with writing to his relationship with his girlfriend. How initially everything is exciting, and how later the excitement dies and both people are in a relationship because they &amp;ldquo;can&#39;t get out&amp;rdquo;
He mentions that he &amp;ldquo;divorced&amp;rdquo; his first blog, for the same reason.</description>
