      <description>These days book I&#39;m reading - Keep Going It has an entire chapter titled
 You are allowed to change your mind&amp;rdquo;
 He talks about how we are &amp;ldquo;afraid&amp;rdquo; to change our mind, as it (now a days) indicates &amp;ldquo;weakness&amp;rdquo;.
Some interesting quotes from this chapter :
 I thought I was wrong about everything. I was wrong about that too.
  If youâ€™ve never changed your mind about something, pinch yourself; you may be dead.</description>
