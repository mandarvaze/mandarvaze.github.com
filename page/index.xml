      <description>History This is probably nth incarnation of this blog.
I started with hosted wordpress. (Still available here)
Then I moved to self hosted wordpress, but I lost the access to it, due to my neglegence (Read about it here)
I was also on (now dead) posterous.
Finally I decided to move away from &amp;ldquo;hosted&amp;rdquo; blogs, and moved to SSG.
I started with pelican.
It took me a while to find a decent theme.</description>
