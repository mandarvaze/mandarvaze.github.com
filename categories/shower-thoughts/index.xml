      <description>I am so grateful that I can have peanuts.
I love peanuts.
Lightly salted.
Lightly roasted without salt.
Cooked (with a little salt)
Or just raw.
Or in Chiwada, or Khichadi
It occurred to me that although it might seem trivial, it is a previledge to be able to eat peanuts.
I know few people - who can not. Because they are old and have &amp;ldquo;teeth problems&amp;rdquo;
Or (as seen on American TV shows) - have peanut allergies.</description>
