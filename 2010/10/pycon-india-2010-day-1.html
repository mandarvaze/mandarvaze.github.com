            <p>Since I had visited MSRIT the <a class="reference external" href="http://mandarvaze.github.io/2010/09/pycon-india-2010-day-zero.html">previous</a> day, I had no problem reaching the venue on time. In fact I reached few minutes earlier, David Goodger was still setting things up. I was able to live tweet using the BSNL 3G USB device I had brought with me. The keynote speech went very well. No complex stuff (like his next session on day 2 about polyform puzzler) it was simple and relevant.</p>
<p>After the keynote - the organizers announced the pass phrase for the WiFi - So some time was spent trying to connect - but I couldn't actually get &quot;usable&quot; internet connectivity. The WiFi would connect, but couldn't get proper Gateway and/or DNS assigned - may be some problem with DHCP. (More about this later) I was getting late for the next session, so I gave up trying to connect to WiFi.</p>
<p>PyCon sessions were spread across 3 different halls. Auditorium and Lecture Hall 1 were next to each other, while I had trouble locating Lecture Hall 2 were Dhananjay Nene was going to start his session at 11AM. There were not clear directions, so finally few of us asked the students for the directions to &quot;HiTech Hall&quot;. Turns out it was in entirely different building, we had to ask few more people for this hall even after reaching the correct building. Dhananjay's session had already started, and the hall was jam-packed.</p>
<p>I got myself a place to sit, and started another attempt to connect to WiFi - Turns out several other people were also having trouble connecting. People from <a class="reference external" href="http://mahiti.org">mahiti</a> tried to help, but couldn't. Since this hall was underground - I also didn't get BSNL signal and couldn't use 3G modem to connect either (got signal for AirTel, Vodafone, spice etc - but so CellOne)</p>
<p>... and suddenly the lights went off. Power was back within few minutes, but by that time participants had started leaving - It disturbed the flow of the presentation though. The presentation went well - but I was able to attend only part of it.</p>
<p>Next session was <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/80">Beyond Django 101</a>  - This session went OK. I noticed that <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/">PyScripter</a> was being used during the session - and made a note to self to try it out.</p>
<p>This session too was delayed, and by the time we left for lunch there was a serpentine queue for lunch. There were just too many people around, I was feeling more hungry just looking at the queue. But the food was good. Had to finish the lunch quickly else I would be late for the next session, which I was really looking forward to.</p>
<p>First session post-lunch was <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/2">GUI programing with PyQT</a>  by Ankur Gupta. That went well as well. He designed firefox like UI using QT designer. Turns out he had a lot to talk and show, but not enough time. The presentation had to wind up due to lack of time. There was hardly any time for QA session. I had a feeling that people wanted to ask questions, but that would have delayed the next session, so QA was skipped. Later while taking to Ankur during tea break, he mentioned that he felt that he should have covered signals and slots a bit earlier during his talk</p>
<p>Next session was <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/33">Introduction to Image Processing in Python</a>  by Anil C R - Initially convered some theory Required quite a bit of background in advanced maths (fourier transform etc) But I learnt about Interactive Python during this session (as part of the demo) This session used live demonstrations heavily which made it very interesting.</p>
<p>Next session was <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/68">Introduction to Semantic Web Programming</a>  - I was bored. May be I didn't understand the topic, or was not able to appreciate the topic.</p>
<p>By this time, <a class="reference external" href="http://mahiti.org">mahiti</a>  person was able to get WiFi working in Lecture Hall 2, and I was able to access internet for a while. Turns out - the default DHCP lease was for 8-12 hours, and thus new folks couldn't get IP addresses assigned. When he manually cleared the list, others like myself were able to connect.</p>
<p>My very first assignment in python required a lot of text parsing - that was a while ago, but still the next topic was interesting for me none the less : <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/57">Text Parsing in Python</a> . The session was divided logically into three parts - Built-in string methods, regular expression and parsers. Good examples were given for each. I think audience liked this session, but again the time allotted wasn't sufficient and at the end she had to rush thru rest of the slides.</p>
<p>During the Tea break I met several folks and got time to talk to them. Till then it was from session to session, and not enough time to interact with folks.&nbsp; Most part of the day I was in Lecture Hall 2, so I decided to attend the next sessions in auditorium <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/81">Into 3D with vPython</a> . The presenter was well prepared - and started with some demo of 3D animation. I also liked the style of the slides he used (The ones he used during the session were different that ones that were uploaded on the site) Generally I liked the presentation style, as well as contents. Since WiFi was working OK in the auditorium, I downloaded vPython during the session - something to try later.</p>
<p>This was the last session of the day, exhausted I left for day. Looking forward t other next day.</p>
<p>On a side note - I noticed that several folks - in the audience as well as presenters were using some flavour of linux - mostly *buntu. Then there were few macs and few Windows 7 laptops (Which I assumed came pre-installed along with the laptop, and folks left it as is and/or dual booted with linux) I was one of the few running XP.</p>
