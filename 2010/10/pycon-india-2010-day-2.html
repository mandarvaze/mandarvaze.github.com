            <p>I reached the venue well in time. (Since it was Sunday morning, probably not much people were traveling) I talked to Praseed and Anil near the registration counter - Apparently some people were registering for day two (May be they missed Day 1 due to other commitments ? But I didn't see the point.) We went to the auditorium for the first session of the day.</p>
<p>The second day also started with David's session just like Day1. He talked about <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/70-polyform-puzzler-and-a-pythonic-algorithm-x">Polyform Puzzler and Pythonic Algorithm X</a> . Based on previous day's experience, I didn't even bother with WiFi, and used BSNL-3G for connectivity. David started by explaining various polyforms, and how he solved the problem initially by brute force. I learnt about <a class="reference external" href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">Psycho</a>  It is JIT that helps improve the execution speed of algorithmic python code up to 300% - One key takeaway from his session was &quot;If external tools like Psycho can help improve the speed of your code - then there may be something wrong with your code - Try analyzing and rewriting&quot;</p>
<p>I wanted to attend Noufal's session <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/9">The Road to PyCon India 2010</a>  but it was going on at the same time as David's session. This is the downside of having multiple parallel tracks - One has to pick and choose. (I also understand, without parallel sessions, conference would run couple more days - and not all sessions are interesting for everyone)</p>
<p>Next session I attended was <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/30">Tracking Tech Trends with Python</a>  .It was about how python program can be written to gather information about various topics. It wasn't about tracking technical trends in python, as I had thought. I was a bit disappointed because it was not what I was expecting. (I should have done my home work - my bad)</p>
<p>Next session <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/5">Building Scalable Apps using Google App Engine</a>  went well - but he too had a lot of talk about and not enough time. The concepts were generic though. One of the &quot;tips&quot; shared was to use NoSQL for datastore as opposed to relational DB - This helps improves the performance, and makes the app scalable. This tied in well with the next session <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/29">NoSQL Primer</a>  .&nbsp; Turns out the presenters were students, and didn't have enough expertise to handle such a &quot;hot&quot; topic. To be fair, the audience started asking questions about NoSQL from the get-go, and it was clear that those people asking questions had more information about NoSQL than the presenters. They switched the presenter mid-stream (hoping that new guy would handle queries better) But the new guy was either too new to python (or nervous) that he kept making silly mistakes when typing python code to demo PyMongo to the audience. Audience had to help him with the syntax - kinda embarrassing.</p>
<p>Today, experience at lunch went well. No long queues- may be because everyone including organizers and participants learnt from previous day. They also served ice-cream (May be they ran out dessert the previous day ??) I had plenty of time to finish my lunch and go back to the auditorium to check my emails and charge my laptop.</p>
<p>Today too, first post lunch session was about GUI programming with python - but instead of QT, it was using GTK. Till before lunch I had no idea what the session named <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/53">Quickly</a>  was going to be about - I checked the page, and decided to attend. I was glad I did. To compare with previous day, the presenter was probably a student, and (may be) bit nervous too. But the presentation was laid out well - accompanied by live demos. The fact that the tool &quot;quickly&quot; makes things easier went in favour of this session (as opposed to PyQT) But based on the presentation, I got a feeling that the tool was too tightly coupled with Ubuntu (Later I found out that the defaults can easily be changed to make it generic)</p>
<p>The next session <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/13">Python object model and introduction to meta programming</a>  was very informative. The presenter was knowledgeable and patient and explained the concepts very well using the live examples. He too ran out of time, and didn't cover meta programming. Due to the overlap, I missed Praseed's session on <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/21">Extending and Embedding Python under Windows ( using C/C++ )</a></p>
<p>I wasn't interested in other sessions that were available and decided to take early tea break. Got to talk to some other folks during the break. By that time, everyone was looking exhausted, and FWIW, none of the post-tea break sessions seemed interesting - Some sessions also were cancelled. They had planned lightening talks in its place, but I didn't attend that.</p>
<p>After the early tea break, I attended the session I wanted to attend since PyCon was announced. <a class="reference external" href="http://in.pycon.org/2010/talks/34">Python on Mobile phones</a>  I wanted this session to go well, and it did.While the session was titled .. on mobile phones .. It was focused on Python on Symbian. The reason why this session went well was because Seshandri had live-projected the image from his Symbian phone on to the screen - so anything he would do on the phone was visible to the entire audience. With such a complex setup - various things can go wrong, but I am glad nothing went wrong - and in my opinion, this was the best session of PyCon India 2010.</p>
<p>All in all, this was the first time I attended any technical conference and my experience was great. I am now looking forward to PyCon India 2011</p>
