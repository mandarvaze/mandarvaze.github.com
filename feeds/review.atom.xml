&lt;div class="section" id="before-the-movie"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Before the Movie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background first. Last time around, there was no publicity for the first movie, on the other hand, This time around there were Plenty of Shows, As well as enough Ads in the newspaper, although I did not see any trailer on any of the TV Channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So during the first (and only) week there were plenty of shows of the movie , Unfortunately the timing was bad. One of the highly anticipated Hindi movie (''Dhoom 3&amp;quot;) was being released a week immediately after, So the Hobbit 2 would not get enough chance. Having said that when I went to watch the movie on a Thursday evening the movie theater was largely empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="impressions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked this movie better than the first one. This could be due to several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-frame-rate"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Frame rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt more engaged in this one compared to the fist part where I was too distracted by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mandarvaze.github.io/2012/12/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey.html"&gt;surreal look&lt;/a&gt; of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it shouldn't matter since I didn't watch the first one in HFR either. BTW, the scene where Biblo reaches the tree tops to &amp;quot;breath&amp;quot; is really a great scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had planned the watch this part in a different movie hall (and a 2D version if possible) it didn't happen. But I did see the movie in a larger auditorium of the same multiplex - This could have had a positive impact on an overall positive experience this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="less-dark-story-contents"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Less Dark Story Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of the story is much more &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; this time around, especially with Bilbo. Thorin is still dark and brooding. Last time there was only Gandalf to help our heroes - this time around, he is gone for a while and doesn't return till the end, but instead we have a pair of elves to help our heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-i-didn-t-like-spoilers"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I didn't like (Spoilers)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the review of Part 1, I didn't like the fact that Peter Jackson did not stay true to the original book. As you might know, J.R.R. Tolkien first wrote &amp;quot;The Hobbit&amp;quot; - a tiny book compared to LOTR trilogy, and then he wrote an epic that is LOTR trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Jackson on the other hand, first make the LOTR trilogy - 3 books, 3 movies, and then made &amp;quot;The Hobbit&amp;quot; - 1 book, 3 movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he had to take a lot of liberty to make 3 movies worth material (For LOTR I'm sure he had exactly opposite problem - how to fit a book into a 3 hour movie) So he added several characters of his own like Bard, Tauriel in this part, and the entire dwarf-elf love story, and how did Legolas got into this book (Peter Jackson brought his here - due to his popularity in the other Trilogy - Thats how) and then why does Legolas have grey eyes here, when he had &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; eyes in the other Trilogy, isn't he the same elf ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tidbits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tidbits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Peter Jackson makes a cameo appearance in the opening scene of the movie, just before we reach &amp;quot;The Prancing Pony&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
