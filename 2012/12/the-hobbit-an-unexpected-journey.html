  <div class="entry-content"><img alt="The Hobbit" src="/images/hobbit.jpg" />
<p>Before I get into my own experience I have some complaints against Peter Jackson and his PR team. Hel,, the &quot;Rise of Guardians&quot; got better publicity (May be due to holiday season and it being kinds movie and/ot due to tie up with McDonald's) &quot;The Hobbit&quot; hardly got any publicity in Pune. If it were not for TV ads, I would not have even known it was released (and I would have mostly missed it) There aren't enough shows in Pune IMO. There were NO ads in the Movie Ads page in DNA.
In addition to all this, Dabbang 2 is releasing next week, taking up all the screens. So my only chance was in the first week. As a LOTR fan, I had to watch it. Unfortunately, there weren't any LOTR fans in my friends/family circle, locally. (Only other LOTR fan I knew was 12 hours away in US) Finally, I watched it before I miss my chance.</p>
<p>When I reached the movie hall, I realized why there wasn't much publicity (or may be it was other way round). There were hardly any people for the show - may be 30 at the max. That means multiplexes were probably running at a loss (Is there such a thing ?)</p>
<p>I watched 3D version - which was most likely HFR version. As others on the interweb have said scenes look surreal. Hence my guess that version I saw was 48FPS one. To explain a little more, it was like looking at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hdr/">HDR</a>  photo. HDR photos look like a great painting. But when you look at a photo, you expect &quot;real like&quot; quality. I had similar feeling when watching The Hobbit. It looks stunning, but you also get the feel that it isn't <em>real</em>. That.</p>
<p>Another complaint I have was that due to 3D glasses having a dark shade, the movie looked less bright. I removed my 3D glasses several times, and saw that projection itself was bright enough, but the 3D glasses made it look dark. I heard few other patrons complaining the same. One girl actually said &quot;There is some problem with the glasses they gave me, I'm getting a replacement&quot; (I doubt she did) Since lot of scenes are indoors, in caves and all, there were a LOT of dark (as in less bright) scenes.</p>
<p>I have a feeling, when the movie is available on DVD (or when they air it on TV) - it will be 2D (and possibly 24FPS) and would <strong>look</strong> much nicer. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.vincentlaforet.com/2012/12/19/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-masterclass-in-why-hfr-fails-and-a-reaffirmation-of-what-makes-cinema-magical/">others</a> who preferred 2D version as well.</p>
<p>Now that technicalities are out of the way, lets review the movie itself.</p>
<p>I had read the LOTR books first - all three of them, and then watched the movies. Then I &quot;ran into&quot; the Hobbit almost by accident. I was in Bandra on a weekend, and happen to see &quot;The Hobbit&quot; at a roadside used-book store. It was a very tiny book compared to three volumes of LOTR. I probably finished it in a day or two (I was working full time then)</p>
<p>Point of all this is that when Peter Jackson made 3 movies from the 3 LOTR books, he had to cut down a lot of story line. The movies were still very lengthy compared to most English movies. But here he stretched a single book into three movies. The result is that it feels a slow movie. The folks who haven't read the book would be looking at their watch (I just stopped short of doing that myself) As an example, in &quot;The Fellowship&quot; - Tolkien narrates the hobbits' journey out of shire very much in detail. I think the visit to Tom Bombadil alone covered about 100 pages, which was omitted altogether from the movie. But here, Jackson chose to show the initial Dwarf Party at Bilbo's house at length. It doesn't add much value to the movie, IMO. While it has been quite some time since I have read the book, considering that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was written  before LOTR books, I doubt it originally contained references to the LOTR movie plots like awakening of Sauron - which eats up some time in the movie at Rivendell. Due to these it takes long time till you reach the adventure part of the story. Since I knew the movie didn't contain the entire book, I kept on thinking - &quot;Ok so now the movie will end, rest in next part&quot; at least couple of times, but movie kept on going.</p>
<p>About the cast - Martin Freeman does a great job as Bilbo. He looks the age too. As per Wikipedia he is 41 in real life but looks much younger in the movie. Not as young as Frodo in LOTR movies, just right. Ian McKellen as already aced the part of Gandalf. Amongst the Dwarves, Richard Armitage is the only one with better role written for him, and does excellent Job of the Prince who has lost his kingdom. For a totally animated character, Gollum was very expressive. His scenes in the cave with Bilbo probably were the highlight of the movie (and the book, as far a I remember)</p>
<p>Next time around, for the second part of the trilogy, I plan to watch the movie in a different movie theater - to check whether the 3D glasses impact the brightness everywhere or whether it was problem with this specific movie hall. I would also try to catch 2D version next time, if they release that.</p>
