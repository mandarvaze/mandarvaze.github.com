<p>I heard this story during one of the personal development courses I attended recently. I think it is worth sharing with you all.</p>
<p>There was a man who constantly complained to the God that there is so much misery in the world, and that the God is not taking care of the World he created in the first place. The Man just complained and whined and nothing more.</p>
<p>Then one day, The God appeared to him in his dreams. The man complained &quot;in person&quot; to The God. After all, how many times does one get to talk to the God, even if it was in your Dreams. The Man made full use of it. The God listened and He smiled. He Said : &quot;I created the world. Sure there are unhappy people in the world. But I also created You&quot;</p>
<p>That was it. The Man woke up from the Dream. God always speaks in mysterious ways. The Man had no clue what the God meant. He was just happy that he could complain to the God Herself.
Days Passed. The Man was back to his routine on whining. After after a few days, there was another dream.</p>
<p>The Man saw that there was a wounded Fox, who could not hunt for food. The Fox was weakening. The Man thought : &quot;I was right. There is so much sadness in this world. The God isn't doing his job&quot;. Then he saw there was a lion(ess?) who had hunted a dear. The Lion ate just the portion of his kill, and left. The wounded fox was near by. As soon as the lion left, he quickly approached the carcass, the ate rest of the dear.</p>
<p>Now the God appeared, and said to the man : &quot;I created this fox, who is now wounded. But I took care of him as well. I made sure that even in his physical condition, he gets to eat.&quot;
The Next Day, the man decided that he need to do anything. He just strolled around the house. Did not go to work. The day passed, he got hungry. But no one served him the food. He was sad. Since he had not eaten through out the day, he felt weak, and dozed off.</p>
<p>In the dream, the God appeared to the Man. Man started complaining again : &quot; God, I trusted you. Yesterday you told me that you take care of everyone. .. and today, I had to go hungry the entire day. That is not fair&quot;</p>
<p>The God smiled and said : &quot;I did not make you the Fox. I made you the Lion&quot;</p>
<p><em>I think this is very thought provoking story. Lot of us go through the life thinking that someone will help us. But how many of us realize that &quot;We are the Lion&quot; ?</em></p>
