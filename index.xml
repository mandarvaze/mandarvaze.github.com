      <title>Happy New Year 2020</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Derek Sivers &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/mny&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new year begins when thereâ€™s a memorable change in my life. Not January 1st. Nothing changes on January 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started reading Austin Kleon&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2QfOUbo&#34;&gt;Keep Going&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it he mentions that &lt;strong&gt;making gifts for others gives you joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mandarvaze.github.io/img/new_year_eve_2019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Origami Frog and Finger Puppet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent New Year Eve 2019 making these for my kids. (6 and 4 as of this writing)
My spouse had to work late (work deadline) and it was just 3 of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making either of these is not possible for kids of their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the finger puppet, the glue had dried, plus it was messy, and it stuck more
to my thumb than to the material it was supposed to stick to ðŸ˜‚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Origami frog had too many complex folds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So neither of them could make it, but they were happy &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elder one &amp;ldquo;decorated&amp;rdquo; the frog with eyes and green color. He did a good job, if I may say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their age - do not understand the concept of time, &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;*. So they didn&#39;t
care there was no &amp;ldquo;celebration&amp;rdquo; for the new year. It was just like any other night. They were happy to spend time with their father. ðŸ¥°&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t care either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who care :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>I Can Have Peanuts</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2019/i-can-have-peanuts/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:18:10 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2019/i-can-have-peanuts/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/8LbcvCZnmyw/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Peanuts&#34;&gt;
I am so grateful that I can have peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightly salted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightly roasted without salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooked (with a little salt)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or just raw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%BE#/media/File:Chivada.JPG&#34;&gt;Chiwada&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabudana_Khichadi#/media/File:Pearl_Tapioca_Khichdi.jpg&#34;&gt;Khichadi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that although it might seem trivial, it is a previledge to be
able to eat peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know few people - who can not. Because they are old and have &amp;ldquo;teeth problems&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or (as seen on American TV shows) - have peanut allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m lucky that I don&#39;t have either problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you God for allowing me such a simple pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scavengers</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/scavengers/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/OegrZj5C9y0/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Scavengers&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actual conversation with my 5 year-old. I was trying to explain about scavengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Do you know what are scavengers ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;him: Yes, à¤†à¤•à¤¾à¤¶à¤¾à¤¤ à¤°à¤¾à¤¹à¤£à¤¾à¤°à¥‡ superheroes à¤¨à¤¾ ? (&lt;em&gt;Superheroes that live in the sky,
right ?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;hellip; ???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: No. Those are &lt;strong&gt;Avengers&lt;/strong&gt; and they don&#39;t &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt; in the sky. Some of
them can just &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me : Scavengers (&lt;em&gt;stressed sk sound when pronouncing&lt;/em&gt;) are those animals who do
not hunt, but eat leftovers when other carnivores are done eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;him : Like hynas ?? (&lt;em&gt;He is really into lion king, lion guard cartoons&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me : Yessss&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tech Interview</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/tech-interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 08:10:49 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/tech-interview/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are actual exchanges from a technical interview I conduced recently. The
person had 2 years experience in an MNC, in what they described as DevOps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: You have mentioned &amp;ldquo;Troubleshooting problems on unix platform. Which
platforms have you worked on ?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: Unix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which one ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: SunOS. I think Solaris. It was UNIX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Why are you leaving this job ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I want to grow technically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: What steps have you taken to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I learnt Django on my own. I created a small app. (&lt;em&gt;Goes on to
describe, album cover art, music file, songwriter etc.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which database did you use ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: SQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which one ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: NoSQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which one ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I don&#39;t remember. I think it was mongodb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Did you have to use any plugin, or was it supported &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;From
what I remember, Django ORM does not support NoSQL, hence the question&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: No plugin or extension&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I don&#39;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Can you explain kind of automation you did, as part of your job ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: We have 100s of servers each with different authentication. We deploy
via ansible playbooks. We do not store the username password in the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Since you mentioned 100s of servers, where do you keep all the auth details
? (&lt;em&gt;I expected them to say &amp;ldquo;Spreadsheet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: It is stored in git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;hellip; (&lt;em&gt;Wha&amp;hellip;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Isn&#39;t this a security risk ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: No, this repo has &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo; permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: I hacker only needs to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; the password, isn&#39;t it ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: Only my team has access. Developers do not have access to this repo
at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/page/about/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:36:14 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/page/about/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably &lt;em&gt;nth&lt;/em&gt; incarnation of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with hosted wordpress. (Still available
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mandarvaze.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to self hosted wordpress, but I lost the access to it, due to my
neglegence (Read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://mandarvaze.github.io/2013/why-i-moved-to-static-blog/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also on (now dead) posterous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided to move away from &amp;ldquo;hosted&amp;rdquo; blogs, and moved to SSG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to find a decent theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was no where near &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; as other themes available for &amp;ldquo;Modern&amp;rdquo; SSGs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had already used hugo for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnings.desipenguin.com&#34;&gt;other
blog&lt;/a&gt; - It was easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the contents are accumulated over several blogs, it contains a lot of
variety. It does contain some &amp;ldquo;technical&amp;rdquo; posts, which I should probably move to
other blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this blog to improve my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You Are a Writer</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/you-are-a-writer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 07:25:19 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/you-are-a-writer/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/Hcfwew744z4/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Writer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a writer. (So start acting like one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading a book by Jeff Goins, with the same name as the title of this
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, he compares his relationship with writing to his relationship with
his girlfriend. How initially everything is exciting, and how later the
excitement dies and both people are in a relationship because they &amp;ldquo;can&#39;t get
out&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentions that he &amp;ldquo;divorced&amp;rdquo; his first blog, for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resonated with me immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog has been neglected for entire of 2018, except for one post in January.
(I have been writing more on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnings.desipenguin.com&#34;&gt;other blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I reflected on &amp;ldquo;why that is ?&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that my old blog was &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; (Or may be it was just an excuse)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided what any geek like myself might do : &amp;ldquo;Give the blog a make over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old blog was in &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpelican.com&#34;&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt; - and it does not have good
themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I have read several blogs which are in (essentially) plain HTML, but have a
lots of content. But decent looking blog does not hurt, right ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other blog uses hugo. So I knew that hugo has host of great themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am excited again to start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I am considering writing without thinking to much. A lot of writers
whom I admire say, start generating content (volume) - quality will improve
eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2017 : Another great year</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/2017-another-great-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 17:04:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/2017-another-great-year/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/1tTLrL50bpA/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Looking Back&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;programming-language&#34;&gt;Programming Language&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the review of 2016, I had written about &amp;ldquo;learning go&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that didn&#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead I picked up &amp;ldquo;elixir&amp;rdquo;. I loved it. I did several exercises
from codewars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the exercises looked too &amp;ldquo;amateurish&amp;rdquo;, but once I hit a
road-block, where I was required to use recursion instead of loops, I
realized that &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; exercises are important to get my head around
the functional paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also purchased my first Udemy course to learn Elixir + Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to use it in a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project, but that didn&#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and towards the end of the year, I again picked up &amp;ldquo;go lang&amp;rdquo; (This is
for a project I will be working on in 2018) This time, I took another
udemy course, by the same instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;non-programming-language&#34;&gt;Non Programming Language&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started learning Esperanto, after learning about it on one of the
freakonomics podcast. I&#39;m using Duolingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language is simple (as claimed) so far. But I am worried that
without regular practice, I might forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-note-taking&#34;&gt;Visual note taking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completed Visual Note taking 101 course by sunni brown Completed &amp;ldquo;Notes
a like a genius&amp;rdquo; course on Udemy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing the Udemy course, took &amp;ldquo;visual&amp;rdquo; notes based on what I
learnt from sunni brown course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at my new (and old)
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/galleries/sketchnotes/&#34;&gt;sketchnotes&lt;/a&gt; on
my other blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journaling&#34;&gt;Journaling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late November, early december, Started journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m applying some principles I learnt in the visual note taking course.
I&#39;m making it &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meditation&#34;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using &amp;ldquo;Insight Timer&amp;rdquo; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, I have been meditating continuously for 279 days since I
began !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I liked about it was variety it provides, but it would have been
nice if there was an option to download the &amp;ldquo;favourite&amp;rdquo; ones, rather
than having to be connected to listen to same one daily. (Recent version
has this as a paid option)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I started using just the timer without any guided
meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not really sure how it impacted me (positively) but at least I got
a good habit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately (early/mid December) I have started doing &amp;ldquo;Isha Kriya&amp;rdquo;. I start
the insight timer when I do it, since it is a form of meditation, and
allows me to record my timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging&#34;&gt;Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t happen as much as 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drawing---sketching&#34;&gt;Drawing - Sketching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been much more deliberate this year. I created an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/mandar_vaze/&#34;&gt;instagram
account&lt;/a&gt; to share my sketches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohh, I also purchased flume, an instragram app for macOS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plans-for-2018&#34;&gt;Plans for 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current project has come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started learning about blockchain, smart contracts and Solidity
development. This is the new area I wish to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; development of both bitcoin and ethereum is in go lang. I
may get a chance to put my &lt;code&gt;go-lang&lt;/code&gt; skills to practical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to blog more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2016 was a great year</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2017/2016-was-a-great-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2017/2016-was-a-great-year/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the highlights of the year gone by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moved-to-spacemacs&#34;&gt;Moved to spacemacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had started experimenting with spacemacs around late 2015. In 2016, I
completely switched to spacemacs. I&#39;m consciously saying spacemacs,
because although it is &amp;ldquo;emacs&amp;rdquo; I am used to spacemacs keybindings, and
may not be able to use &amp;ldquo;plain&amp;rdquo; emacs on any other system. (Turns out
it is said that unlike vi/vim, no two emacs users can use each others
system, because of heavy personal customizations.ðŸ˜‰ )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used spacemacs mainly for python development, but used org-mode as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried using &lt;code&gt;mu4e&lt;/code&gt; partially successfully for a while,
but gave up. Time to give it another go in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogged&#34;&gt;Blogged&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote 28 posts on my (relatively) new
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/2016/index.html&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; Not enough on
this blog though. I mean to combined both of them this year.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.github.io/2016/08/easier-blogging.html#finalize-the-blog-home&#34;&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it worked ? I had clear focus about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to write about. Also, I
had decided to &amp;ldquo;just ship it&amp;rdquo; rather than keep editing the draft till
it is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sketched&#34;&gt;Sketched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did about 25
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/galleries/sketches/&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the initial ones are scanned/uploaded almost as a second thought
(and it was. They were drawn to amuse my son, hence &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; paper would
do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I because a bit conscious. Now I draw for myself. Hence better
&amp;ldquo;paper&amp;rdquo;, background etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shipped-product&#34;&gt;Shipped Product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I shipped one more product. This is my third product which I
created from the ground up. Earlier two products are in web2py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, I did several things differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used REST API + Javascript for the front end - style architecture.
(Just to be clear, I created the REST API, someone else worked on
the web app and the android app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Python Eve framework (based on flask)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started writing unit test cases (using &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;).
Helped a lot with a big refactoring effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote API documentation using &lt;code&gt;sphinx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used gitlab (Earlier products used privately hosted git repo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plans-for-2017&#34;&gt;Plans for 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start using golang seriously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email within spacemacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue blogging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue drawing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>6 things to make (my) blogging frictionless</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2016/6-things-to-make-my-blogging-frictionless/</link>

      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2016/6-things-to-make-my-blogging-frictionless/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/vZJdYl5JVXY/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Friction&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflection on some issues I faced. If you find some of these useful, great.
The post is not intended as an advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I heard the talk python to me podcast where A. Jesse Davis was
interviewed. The topic was a bit different than usual python related
topics. It was about how to make blogging easy. Jesse talks about
several nice things, including the fact that why we should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; feel
guilty for not blogging regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should listen to the podcast
&lt;a href=&#34;https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
if you have not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea was at the back of my mind for a while, and this post is
sort of brain dump of why I am unable to &lt;strong&gt;publish&lt;/strong&gt; regularly inspite
of having content written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;finalize-the-source-format&#34;&gt;Finalize the source format&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept moving between &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt;. I liked &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; when I started
using emacs. (In fact that was &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; reason to start using emacs) So
few of my initial posts are in &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; I had one post in &lt;code&gt;asciidoc&lt;/code&gt; as
well. But I think I will stick to reStructuredText mainly because most
of the static site generators will have support for this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even bigger number probably support &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; but then there is no
standardization, you have too many flavors out there. Also, I think
&lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; is bit more &lt;em&gt;richer&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one post in &lt;code&gt;asciidoc&lt;/code&gt; as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;createuse-templates&#34;&gt;Create/Use templates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the thoughts on paper (so to speak) I start typing in an
empty file. By the time I am done, I have very unformatted text that
requires &amp;ldquo;formatting&amp;rdquo;, and this is where the delay in &amp;ldquo;publishing&amp;rdquo;
comes in. I have so many written-but-unpublished posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having templates with headers and categories/tags pre-populated would be
good way to reduce the friction. Jesse talks about how we mostly have
about 5 different types of posts. May be create just 5 templates for 5
&amp;ldquo;types&amp;rdquo; of blogs, and remove the decision making from choosing the
categories and tags. (I never remember the list of categories and tags I
have used, and always have to search the older posts to get the list,
sorta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On second thoughts, I think nikola already has a script to create a new
posts. May be I ought to use that ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;write-more-frequently&#34;&gt;Write more frequently&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem confusing. Let me explain. As I mentioned that I usually
start writing as a plain text, and later &amp;ldquo;format&amp;rdquo; the contents. One of
reasons why this happens is because I can&#39;t remember the syntax at the
time of writing. (and that happens when one keeps switching between
&lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt;. See the first point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I write more often using only one platform, the &amp;ldquo;formatting&amp;rdquo; syntax
will be part of my memory. I already write the documentation (using
sphinx) in &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; -another reason to finalize on &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;finalize-the-blogging-platform&#34;&gt;Finalize the blogging platform&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one blog in pelican. (This one. updated after a long time) and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io&#34;&gt;other blog&lt;/a&gt; in nikola. Switching
between them just takes mental effort. If I were to standardize on it,
there won&#39;t be &amp;ldquo;switching trouble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to consider &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, but my initial attempts to get a blog
rolling with a theme-that-i-like hasn&#39;t worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But irrespective of the blog generator, if I standardize on
reStructuredText, I don&#39;t have to worry about switching the blog
generators (I think)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;finalize-the-blog-home&#34;&gt;Finalize the blog home&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, having single home for my blogs also might be good
idea. It is always an effort to decide where should a specific post go.
While with my second blog, the idea is very clear - it is about &amp;ldquo;what I
learnt&amp;rdquo;, so things like &amp;ldquo;thoughts&amp;rdquo; should not go there. Yet,
sometimes it is not easy. May be just have one blog with category as
&amp;ldquo;wiltw&amp;rdquo; (short for &amp;ldquo;What I learnt this week&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;focus-on-the-content&#34;&gt;Focus on the content&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am never happy with the themes. I was almost happy with Material
Design theme for nikola, but it could not render bullets (can you
imagine?) So I switched to a simpler theme. But I am not happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I should just pick one up, stick with it, and not worry about the
&amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read several great blogs that look down right ugly, but the
contents are worth in gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publish-now-refine-later&#34;&gt;Publish now, refine later&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectionist in me wants to read-edit-read a LOT after my initial
writing is done. I spend a lot of time in this. May be I should just
publish it first, and then refine it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I moved to Static Blog ?</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2013/why-i-moved-to-static-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2013/why-i-moved-to-static-blog/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com//1CrN-IbvtH0/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Pelican&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little bit of a histoy of my blog at various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my third attempt at blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wordpresscom&#34;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; one is still on hosted
wordpress site. In a way, that is nice. Pretty much no administration
needed. One can install the plugins that are tested by wordpress.com
They also upgrade the platform for you. Great for testing the waters for
the first time blogger. I think it is better than blogspot (&lt;em&gt;I can&#39;t
remember if I had one of those, and moved to wordpress&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-hosted-wordpress&#34;&gt;Self-hosted Wordpress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a while one (&lt;em&gt;at least, I&lt;/em&gt;) becomes ambitious. I had my own
wordpress blog hosted on my own domain. It was a great experience. I got
to try my hands at setting my blog &lt;em&gt;just the way I want&lt;/em&gt;. But after
initial excitement was over, it started to become burden. One had to
spend a lot more time administering the blog (upgrade to latest version
of wordpress, and the plugins) and less focus on writing. I never
upgrade the blog to wordpress 3 (&lt;em&gt;which by now is very mature&lt;/em&gt;) I always
kept postponing it because upgrade might &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; things, so I would do
it when I have enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after a while I wasn&#39;t writing much, and stopped paying
attention to the blog. I had also used my &lt;em&gt;non-standard&lt;/em&gt; email ID with
the hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cascading effect was recently I lost access to my blog and the
domain. It was completely my fault. My hosting provider did send
multiple reminders for renewal, but I wasn&#39;t checking that account
often enough, and when I finally did, they had probably given up. (&lt;em&gt;I
did contact them later, but they ignored my emails&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I definitely learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;posterous&#34;&gt;Posterous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then while I still had my self-hosted wordpress blog, along came
posterous. What I liked about them was I could post via email. I really
liked the concept. They didn&#39;t great themes like wordpress, but if the
focus was writing, then it shouldn&#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;. and then they were acquired by twitter. As everyone had predicted,
twitter shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was kinda the last straw. I had two blows back to back (One was my
own fault, other not so much) But the result was in both cases, I had
lost access to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finally-static-website-&#34;&gt;Finally, Static website &amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the time, static website generators were picking up. Over at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34;&gt;HN&lt;/a&gt; I came across several options like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org/&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; . (&lt;em&gt;I chose Pelican because it
is written in Python, language which I am comfortable with, as opposed
to Jekyll and Octopress.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to host the static website anywhere, include the Free Heroku
plan (Which I might do in future) But hosting it on github seemed like
an easy and popular choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I did get a backup of all my posterous posts, but they were in XML
format. Format which was not useful to me as-it-is. There is a ruby
script that &amp;ldquo;downloads&amp;rdquo; all your posterous posts and converts them to
markdown. It was not without problems, but it worked. But it is a topic
for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;securing-the-source&#34;&gt;Securing the source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my recent experience, I am aware that github might one fine day
decide to stop supporting this feature. But if they did, that is OK too,
because I will still have access to my contents in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mandarvaze/mandarvaze-blog-src&#34;&gt;git
repo&lt;/a&gt; in the form of
&amp;ldquo;source code&amp;rdquo; With Pelican I can re-generate the pages, and host it
someplace else (like Heroku)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if github shuts down (or makes all accounts paid, or bought over my
big company, and the parent company shuts it down, whatever..) I have
already thought of contingency plan for that as well. I push the same
&amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/mandarvaze/mandarvaze-blog-src&#34;&gt;bitbucket
repo&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think chances of both github &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; bitbucket going away at the
same time are slim to none, One can always have the copy of local git
repo in the dropbox folder, for additional security, Can you not ? :)&lt;/p&gt;
