      <title>Thumbnail Sketches</title>

&lt;p&gt;I learned about thumbnail sketches in one of the skillshare classes I took a while ago. The teacher suggested that we draw very small sketches to hash out the idea. Map the elements in the entire space etc. After drawing couple of thumbnails about the same topic, we select the one that we like the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never did any such thing - mostly because I hardly draw that way, where I pickup a topic, think of various ways I can represent it etc. None the less, the idea was fascinating. Thumbnail sketches can be really nice. Teacher actually coloured some of them as well, in order to plan how it will appear in the final sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to show my son how to draw various trees for his school work. Without thinking, I drew a couple of thumbnails for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even if one does not apply something that they learnt immediately (or in the field where it was meant to be applied) it looks like it is always beneficial. It stays with you, and comes back to you when you need it (whether you know it or not)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aladdin</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/aladdin/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Aladdin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Aladdin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night we watched live action &amp;ldquo;Aladdin&amp;rdquo; with the family - on TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First reaction - I liked the animated one better.
Second reaction - I liked the animated one better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might sound strange - but animated Aladdin and Genie actor &amp;ldquo;acted&amp;rdquo; better
than their live action counter parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live action Jasmine (Naomi Scott) was better than the animated one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They changed a story a little. I don&#39;t remember &amp;ldquo;throwing Ali into the water&amp;rdquo;
scene from the animated movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jafar threw Aladdin &amp;ldquo;to the other side of the world&amp;rdquo; - it felt like he
was in &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; danger while watching the animated one.
In the live action one, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final &amp;ldquo;battle&amp;rdquo; also seemed to matter in the animated movie when Jafar trapped
Jasmine in the time piece. Not so much in the live action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same with &amp;ldquo;Getting out of the Cave&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the difference may be watching in the movie hall (Animated) Vs TV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did like the dance routines, and Prince Ali&#39;s parade. They looked awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be unfair to compare Will Smith to Robin Williams - but Will Smith
had his moments. We laughed at couple of his jokes (which I don&#39;t remember
from the animated one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None the less, Kids enjoyed this one a lot. Elder one remembered a little
bit of the animated one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.focusmate.com/&#34;&gt;focus mate&lt;/a&gt;. Main principle is Human
Accountability. You start a video session with a stranger and just do your work.
This happens while the video camera is ON. I suppose just the fact that someone
is watching you, alone prevents you from procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see it working for at least some personality types, for whom external
accountability matters more. (Obligers)
I assume people for whom internal accountability matters do not procrastinate at
all. (I may be wrong)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are &lt;em&gt;rebels&lt;/em&gt; (As per Gretchen Ruben&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gretchenrubin.com/2013/01/four-personality-types-which-one-are-you&#34;&gt;personality
types&lt;/a&gt;)
who do not give a damn one way or the other. I suppose such people may not even
want to start a session.just because &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m gonna try it. They have a few free sessions, just to try out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2019 Review</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/2019-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/2019-review/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/6nrE8WMLCMA/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;look back&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier I wrote about how Jan 1st is not a special date in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I still believe that for starting something new, or changing, calendar
years give us well defined time against which we measure progress (and make
plans. Or is it the other way around ?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;365/366 days is well agreed upon time. So it is as good as 30 or 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we can &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; any day and &amp;ldquo;look back&amp;rdquo; approximately 360 days later, we
are more likely to do that when everyone considers starting a new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough defending my (conflicting) views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us look at 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging&#34;&gt;Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I switched themes for both my blogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote 9 blog posts during first half (and none during the second half. See the
next point.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started seriously using TiddlyWiki. That has been my most updated &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; (?)
in later part of 2019. I have written about friction-less blogging. TiddlyWiki
is the closest to zero friction. The file is an HTML. I only have to &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; is every once in a while (Thus TW on my machine is more up to date than
published one.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Udemy courses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pen and Ink Sketching (completed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started learning Elm using various free resources, but dropped it. I might
pick it up again at a later date though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drawing---sketching&#34;&gt;Drawing - Sketching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not post lot of my sketches on my blog. But I posted more on instagram
(less friction to publish directly from the phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16 on instagram, only 5 of those on my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drew  a lot more throw away sketches for my kids, but did not always take
pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misc&#34;&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was without assignment one third of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allowed me to focus on learning.
But to be honest, I tried to &amp;ldquo;start learning&amp;rdquo; too many things. (See section
about learning)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last assignment was with Niteo. I consider it to be time most well spent. I
wish I could have continued longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Niteo, my MBP &amp;ldquo;died&amp;rdquo;. I think it was SSD. Got it repaired by &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo;
shop much cheaper than official one. So far so good. 🤞
I rented a dell laptop and installed Ubuntu (and once my MBP was back, Deepin)
on it. The development tasks were easy/same as macOS. But I have grown used to
macOS now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plans-for-2020&#34;&gt;Plans for 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing my similar sections from past review posts, I have realized that I was
very bad at predicting future and planning for it. (There are some people who
plan and follow thru, and I admire them, and want to be like them.)
able to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things I see myself continuing is use of TW.
I also started another TW - which is personal. I&#39;m using it as my online diary.
Since no one is gonna see it, I feel less conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to use it for &amp;ldquo;Morning Pages&amp;rdquo; (Originally Julia Cameroon, made popular by Tim Ferriss)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart reader may have noticed that there is no review for 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Change What You Don&#39;t Like</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/change-what-you-dont-like/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 13:06:35 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/change-what-you-dont-like/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/mG28olYFgHI/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Change&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days book I&#39;m reading -  &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2QfOUbo&#34;&gt;Keep Going&lt;/a&gt; It has an entire chapter titled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are allowed to change your mind&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks about how we are &amp;ldquo;afraid&amp;rdquo; to change our mind, as it (now a days) indicates &amp;ldquo;weakness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting quotes from this chapter :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was wrong about everything.
I was wrong about that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never changed your mind about something, pinch yourself; you may be
dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.. be open to possibility and allow yourself to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(My full notes about the book
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.desipenguin.com/#Keep%20Going%3A%2010%20Ways%20to%20Stay%20Creative%20in%20Good%20Times%20and%20Bad&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I had when blogging was assigning Categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand tags, there are usually a LOT (I assume that is expected.)
I assumed Categories need to be &amp;ldquo;limited&amp;rdquo; - Somehow I started using categories
and tags interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That did not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially (pelican, nikola) there used to be one category for a post (and
multiple tags)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with hugo - even multiple categories are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This added to (my) confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; categories in the older posts so that I can use consistent
categories. It was painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never occurred to me to completely get rid of them. Till now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I had Categories and Tags are menus, so that readers can find posts
that belong to specific taxonomy. But I am not sure how many regular readers I
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So starting with this blog, I&#39;ve decided to not use categories for the new posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also removed Categories for the old posts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Happy New Year 2020</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/happy-new-year-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 06:09:58 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2020/happy-new-year-2020/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Derek Sivers &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/mny&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new year begins when there’s a memorable change in my life. Not January 1st. Nothing changes on January 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started reading Austin Kleon&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2QfOUbo&#34;&gt;Keep Going&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it he mentions that &lt;strong&gt;making gifts for others gives you joy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mandarvaze.github.io/img/new_year_eve_2019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Origami Frog and Finger Puppet&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent New Year Eve 2019 making these for my kids. (6 and 4 as of this writing)
My spouse had to work late (work deadline) and it was just 3 of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making either of these is not possible for kids of their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the finger puppet, the glue had dried, plus it was messy, and it stuck more
to my thumb than to the material it was supposed to stick to 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Origami frog had too many complex folds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So neither of them could make it, but they were happy &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo; me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elder one &amp;ldquo;decorated&amp;rdquo; the frog with eyes and green color. He did a good job, if I may say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their age - do not understand the concept of time, &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;*. So they didn&#39;t
care there was no &amp;ldquo;celebration&amp;rdquo; for the new year. It was just like any other night. They were happy to spend time with their father. 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t care either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who care :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>I Can Have Peanuts</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2019/i-can-have-peanuts/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:18:10 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2019/i-can-have-peanuts/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/8LbcvCZnmyw/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Peanuts&#34;&gt;
I am so grateful that I can have peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightly salted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightly roasted without salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooked (with a little salt)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or just raw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%BE#/media/File:Chivada.JPG&#34;&gt;Chiwada&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabudana_Khichadi#/media/File:Pearl_Tapioca_Khichdi.jpg&#34;&gt;Khichadi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that although it might seem trivial, it is a previledge to be
able to eat peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know few people - who can not. Because they are old and have &amp;ldquo;teeth problems&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or (as seen on American TV shows) - have peanut allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m lucky that I don&#39;t have either problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you God for allowing me such a simple pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actual conversation with my 5 year-old. I was trying to explain about scavengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Do you know what are scavengers ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;him: Yes, आकाशात राहणारे superheroes ना ? (&lt;em&gt;Superheroes that live in the sky,
right ?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;hellip; ???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: No. Those are &lt;strong&gt;Avengers&lt;/strong&gt; and they don&#39;t &lt;strong&gt;live&lt;/strong&gt; in the sky. Some of
them can just &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me : Scavengers (&lt;em&gt;stressed sk sound when pronouncing&lt;/em&gt;) are those animals who do
not hunt, but eat leftovers when other carnivores are done eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;him : Like hynas ?? (&lt;em&gt;He is really into lion king, lion guard cartoons&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me : Yessss&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tech Interview</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/tech-interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 08:10:49 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/tech-interview/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are actual exchanges from a technical interview I conduced recently. The
person had 2 years experience in an MNC, in what they described as DevOps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: You have mentioned &amp;ldquo;Troubleshooting problems on unix platform. Which
platforms have you worked on ?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: Unix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which one ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: SunOS. I think Solaris. It was UNIX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Why are you leaving this job ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I want to grow technically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: What steps have you taken to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I learnt Django on my own. I created a small app. (&lt;em&gt;Goes on to
describe, album cover art, music file, songwriter etc.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which database did you use ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: SQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which one ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: NoSQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Which one ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I don&#39;t remember. I think it was mongodb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Did you have to use any plugin, or was it supported &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;From
what I remember, Django ORM does not support NoSQL, hence the question&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: No plugin or extension&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: I don&#39;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Can you explain kind of automation you did, as part of your job ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: We have 100s of servers each with different authentication. We deploy
via ansible playbooks. We do not store the username password in the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Since you mentioned 100s of servers, where do you keep all the auth details
? (&lt;em&gt;I expected them to say &amp;ldquo;Spreadsheet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: It is stored in git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;hellip; (&lt;em&gt;Wha&amp;hellip;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Isn&#39;t this a security risk ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: No, this repo has &amp;ldquo;read-only&amp;rdquo; permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: I hacker only needs to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; the password, isn&#39;t it ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate: Only my team has access. Developers do not have access to this repo
at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/page/about/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably &lt;em&gt;nth&lt;/em&gt; incarnation of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with hosted wordpress. (Still available
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mandarvaze.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to self hosted wordpress, but I lost the access to it, due to my
neglegence (Read about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://mandarvaze.github.io/2013/why-i-moved-to-static-blog/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also on (now dead) posterous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided to move away from &amp;ldquo;hosted&amp;rdquo; blogs, and moved to SSG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to find a decent theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was no where near &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; as other themes available for &amp;ldquo;Modern&amp;rdquo; SSGs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I had already used hugo for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnings.desipenguin.com&#34;&gt;other
blog&lt;/a&gt; - It was easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contents&#34;&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the contents are accumulated over several blogs, it contains a lot of
variety. It does contain some &amp;ldquo;technical&amp;rdquo; posts, which I should probably move to
other blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this blog to improve my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You Are a Writer</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/you-are-a-writer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 07:25:19 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/you-are-a-writer/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/Hcfwew744z4/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Writer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a writer. (So start acting like one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading a book by Jeff Goins, with the same name as the title of this
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, he compares his relationship with writing to his relationship with
his girlfriend. How initially everything is exciting, and how later the
excitement dies and both people are in a relationship because they &amp;ldquo;can&#39;t get
out&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentions that he &amp;ldquo;divorced&amp;rdquo; his first blog, for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resonated with me immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog has been neglected for entire of 2018, except for one post in January.
(I have been writing more on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnings.desipenguin.com&#34;&gt;other blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I reflected on &amp;ldquo;why that is ?&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that my old blog was &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; (Or may be it was just an excuse)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided what any geek like myself might do : &amp;ldquo;Give the blog a make over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old blog was in &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpelican.com&#34;&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt; - and it does not have good
themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I have read several blogs which are in (essentially) plain HTML, but have a
lots of content. But decent looking blog does not hurt, right ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other blog uses hugo. So I knew that hugo has host of great themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am excited again to start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I am considering writing without thinking to much. A lot of writers
whom I admire say, start generating content (volume) - quality will improve
eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2017 : Another great year</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/2017-another-great-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 17:04:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2018/2017-another-great-year/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/1tTLrL50bpA/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Looking Back&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;programming-language&#34;&gt;Programming Language&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the review of 2016, I had written about &amp;ldquo;learning go&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that didn&#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead I picked up &amp;ldquo;elixir&amp;rdquo;. I loved it. I did several exercises
from codewars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the exercises looked too &amp;ldquo;amateurish&amp;rdquo;, but once I hit a
road-block, where I was required to use recursion instead of loops, I
realized that &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; exercises are important to get my head around
the functional paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also purchased my first Udemy course to learn Elixir + Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to use it in a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project, but that didn&#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and towards the end of the year, I again picked up &amp;ldquo;go lang&amp;rdquo; (This is
for a project I will be working on in 2018) This time, I took another
udemy course, by the same instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;non-programming-language&#34;&gt;Non Programming Language&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started learning Esperanto, after learning about it on one of the
freakonomics podcast. I&#39;m using Duolingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language is simple (as claimed) so far. But I am worried that
without regular practice, I might forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-note-taking&#34;&gt;Visual note taking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completed Visual Note taking 101 course by sunni brown Completed &amp;ldquo;Notes
a like a genius&amp;rdquo; course on Udemy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing the Udemy course, took &amp;ldquo;visual&amp;rdquo; notes based on what I
learnt from sunni brown course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at my new (and old)
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/galleries/sketchnotes/&#34;&gt;sketchnotes&lt;/a&gt; on
my other blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journaling&#34;&gt;Journaling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late November, early december, Started journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still figuring it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m applying some principles I learnt in the visual note taking course.
I&#39;m making it &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meditation&#34;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using &amp;ldquo;Insight Timer&amp;rdquo; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, I have been meditating continuously for 279 days since I
began !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I liked about it was variety it provides, but it would have been
nice if there was an option to download the &amp;ldquo;favourite&amp;rdquo; ones, rather
than having to be connected to listen to same one daily. (Recent version
has this as a paid option)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I started using just the timer without any guided
meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not really sure how it impacted me (positively) but at least I got
a good habit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately (early/mid December) I have started doing &amp;ldquo;Isha Kriya&amp;rdquo;. I start
the insight timer when I do it, since it is a form of meditation, and
allows me to record my timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogging&#34;&gt;Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&#39;t happen as much as 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drawing---sketching&#34;&gt;Drawing - Sketching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been much more deliberate this year. I created an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/mandar_vaze/&#34;&gt;instagram
account&lt;/a&gt; to share my sketches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohh, I also purchased flume, an instragram app for macOS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plans-for-2018&#34;&gt;Plans for 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current project has come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started learning about blockchain, smart contracts and Solidity
development. This is the new area I wish to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; development of both bitcoin and ethereum is in go lang. I
may get a chance to put my &lt;code&gt;go-lang&lt;/code&gt; skills to practical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to blog more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2016 was a great year</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2017/2016-was-a-great-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2017/2016-was-a-great-year/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the highlights of the year gone by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moved-to-spacemacs&#34;&gt;Moved to spacemacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had started experimenting with spacemacs around late 2015. In 2016, I
completely switched to spacemacs. I&#39;m consciously saying spacemacs,
because although it is &amp;ldquo;emacs&amp;rdquo; I am used to spacemacs keybindings, and
may not be able to use &amp;ldquo;plain&amp;rdquo; emacs on any other system. (Turns out
it is said that unlike vi/vim, no two emacs users can use each others
system, because of heavy personal customizations.😉 )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used spacemacs mainly for python development, but used org-mode as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried using &lt;code&gt;mu4e&lt;/code&gt; partially successfully for a while,
but gave up. Time to give it another go in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blogged&#34;&gt;Blogged&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrote 28 posts on my (relatively) new
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/2016/index.html&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; Not enough on
this blog though. I mean to combined both of them this year.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.github.io/2016/08/easier-blogging.html#finalize-the-blog-home&#34;&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it worked ? I had clear focus about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to write about. Also, I
had decided to &amp;ldquo;just ship it&amp;rdquo; rather than keep editing the draft till
it is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sketched&#34;&gt;Sketched&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did about 25
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io/galleries/sketches/&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the initial ones are scanned/uploaded almost as a second thought
(and it was. They were drawn to amuse my son, hence &amp;ldquo;any&amp;rdquo; paper would
do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I because a bit conscious. Now I draw for myself. Hence better
&amp;ldquo;paper&amp;rdquo;, background etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shipped-product&#34;&gt;Shipped Product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I shipped one more product. This is my third product which I
created from the ground up. Earlier two products are in web2py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, I did several things differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used REST API + Javascript for the front end - style architecture.
(Just to be clear, I created the REST API, someone else worked on
the web app and the android app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Python Eve framework (based on flask)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started writing unit test cases (using &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;).
Helped a lot with a big refactoring effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote API documentation using &lt;code&gt;sphinx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used gitlab (Earlier products used privately hosted git repo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plans-for-2017&#34;&gt;Plans for 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start using golang seriously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email within spacemacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue blogging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue drawing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>6 things to make (my) blogging frictionless</title>
      <link>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2016/6-things-to-make-my-blogging-frictionless/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mandarvaze.github.io/2016/6-things-to-make-my-blogging-frictionless/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/vZJdYl5JVXY/750x350&#34; alt=&#34;Friction&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reflection on some issues I faced. If you find some of these useful, great.
The post is not intended as an advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I heard the talk python to me podcast where A. Jesse Davis was
interviewed. The topic was a bit different than usual python related
topics. It was about how to make blogging easy. Jesse talks about
several nice things, including the fact that why we should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; feel
guilty for not blogging regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should listen to the podcast
&lt;a href=&#34;https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/69/write-an-excellent-programming-blog&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
if you have not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea was at the back of my mind for a while, and this post is
sort of brain dump of why I am unable to &lt;strong&gt;publish&lt;/strong&gt; regularly inspite
of having content written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;finalize-the-source-format&#34;&gt;Finalize the source format&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept moving between &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt;. I liked &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; when I started
using emacs. (In fact that was &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; reason to start using emacs) So
few of my initial posts are in &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; I had one post in &lt;code&gt;asciidoc&lt;/code&gt; as
well. But I think I will stick to reStructuredText mainly because most
of the static site generators will have support for this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even bigger number probably support &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; but then there is no
standardization, you have too many flavors out there. Also, I think
&lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; is bit more &lt;em&gt;richer&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one post in &lt;code&gt;asciidoc&lt;/code&gt; as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;createuse-templates&#34;&gt;Create/Use templates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the thoughts on paper (so to speak) I start typing in an
empty file. By the time I am done, I have very unformatted text that
requires &amp;ldquo;formatting&amp;rdquo;, and this is where the delay in &amp;ldquo;publishing&amp;rdquo;
comes in. I have so many written-but-unpublished posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having templates with headers and categories/tags pre-populated would be
good way to reduce the friction. Jesse talks about how we mostly have
about 5 different types of posts. May be create just 5 templates for 5
&amp;ldquo;types&amp;rdquo; of blogs, and remove the decision making from choosing the
categories and tags. (I never remember the list of categories and tags I
have used, and always have to search the older posts to get the list,
sorta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On second thoughts, I think nikola already has a script to create a new
posts. May be I ought to use that ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;write-more-frequently&#34;&gt;Write more frequently&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem confusing. Let me explain. As I mentioned that I usually
start writing as a plain text, and later &amp;ldquo;format&amp;rdquo; the contents. One of
reasons why this happens is because I can&#39;t remember the syntax at the
time of writing. (and that happens when one keeps switching between
&lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt;. See the first point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I write more often using only one platform, the &amp;ldquo;formatting&amp;rdquo; syntax
will be part of my memory. I already write the documentation (using
sphinx) in &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; -another reason to finalize on &lt;code&gt;rst&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;finalize-the-blogging-platform&#34;&gt;Finalize the blogging platform&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one blog in pelican. (This one. updated after a long time) and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.bitbucket.io&#34;&gt;other blog&lt;/a&gt; in nikola. Switching
between them just takes mental effort. If I were to standardize on it,
there won&#39;t be &amp;ldquo;switching trouble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to consider &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, but my initial attempts to get a blog
rolling with a theme-that-i-like hasn&#39;t worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But irrespective of the blog generator, if I standardize on
reStructuredText, I don&#39;t have to worry about switching the blog
generators (I think)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;finalize-the-blog-home&#34;&gt;Finalize the blog home&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, having single home for my blogs also might be good
idea. It is always an effort to decide where should a specific post go.
While with my second blog, the idea is very clear - it is about &amp;ldquo;what I
learnt&amp;rdquo;, so things like &amp;ldquo;thoughts&amp;rdquo; should not go there. Yet,
sometimes it is not easy. May be just have one blog with category as
&amp;ldquo;wiltw&amp;rdquo; (short for &amp;ldquo;What I learnt this week&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;focus-on-the-content&#34;&gt;Focus on the content&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am never happy with the themes. I was almost happy with Material
Design theme for nikola, but it could not render bullets (can you
imagine?) So I switched to a simpler theme. But I am not happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I should just pick one up, stick with it, and not worry about the
&amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read several great blogs that look down right ugly, but the
contents are worth in gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publish-now-refine-later&#34;&gt;Publish now, refine later&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectionist in me wants to read-edit-read a LOT after my initial
writing is done. I spend a lot of time in this. May be I should just
publish it first, and then refine it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I moved to Static Blog ?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Little bit of a histoy of my blog at various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my third attempt at blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wordpresscom&#34;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mandarvaze.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; one is still on hosted
wordpress site. In a way, that is nice. Pretty much no administration
needed. One can install the plugins that are tested by wordpress.com
They also upgrade the platform for you. Great for testing the waters for
the first time blogger. I think it is better than blogspot (&lt;em&gt;I can&#39;t
remember if I had one of those, and moved to wordpress&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-hosted-wordpress&#34;&gt;Self-hosted Wordpress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a while one (&lt;em&gt;at least, I&lt;/em&gt;) becomes ambitious. I had my own
wordpress blog hosted on my own domain. It was a great experience. I got
to try my hands at setting my blog &lt;em&gt;just the way I want&lt;/em&gt;. But after
initial excitement was over, it started to become burden. One had to
spend a lot more time administering the blog (upgrade to latest version
of wordpress, and the plugins) and less focus on writing. I never
upgrade the blog to wordpress 3 (&lt;em&gt;which by now is very mature&lt;/em&gt;) I always
kept postponing it because upgrade might &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; things, so I would do
it when I have enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after a while I wasn&#39;t writing much, and stopped paying
attention to the blog. I had also used my &lt;em&gt;non-standard&lt;/em&gt; email ID with
the hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cascading effect was recently I lost access to my blog and the
domain. It was completely my fault. My hosting provider did send
multiple reminders for renewal, but I wasn&#39;t checking that account
often enough, and when I finally did, they had probably given up. (&lt;em&gt;I
did contact them later, but they ignored my emails&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I definitely learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;posterous&#34;&gt;Posterous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then while I still had my self-hosted wordpress blog, along came
posterous. What I liked about them was I could post via email. I really
liked the concept. They didn&#39;t great themes like wordpress, but if the
focus was writing, then it shouldn&#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;. and then they were acquired by twitter. As everyone had predicted,
twitter shut them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was kinda the last straw. I had two blows back to back (One was my
own fault, other not so much) But the result was in both cases, I had
lost access to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;finally-static-website-&#34;&gt;Finally, Static website &amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the time, static website generators were picking up. Over at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34;&gt;HN&lt;/a&gt; I came across several options like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://octopress.org/&#34;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; . (&lt;em&gt;I chose Pelican because it
is written in Python, language which I am comfortable with, as opposed
to Jekyll and Octopress.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to host the static website anywhere, include the Free Heroku
plan (Which I might do in future) But hosting it on github seemed like
an easy and popular choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I did get a backup of all my posterous posts, but they were in XML
format. Format which was not useful to me as-it-is. There is a ruby
script that &amp;ldquo;downloads&amp;rdquo; all your posterous posts and converts them to
markdown. It was not without problems, but it worked. But it is a topic
for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;securing-the-source&#34;&gt;Securing the source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my recent experience, I am aware that github might one fine day
decide to stop supporting this feature. But if they did, that is OK too,
because I will still have access to my contents in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mandarvaze/mandarvaze-blog-src&#34;&gt;git
repo&lt;/a&gt; in the form of
&amp;ldquo;source code&amp;rdquo; With Pelican I can re-generate the pages, and host it
someplace else (like Heroku)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if github shuts down (or makes all accounts paid, or bought over my
big company, and the parent company shuts it down, whatever..) I have
already thought of contingency plan for that as well. I push the same
&amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitbucket.org/mandarvaze/mandarvaze-blog-src&#34;&gt;bitbucket
repo&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think chances of both github &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; bitbucket going away at the
same time are slim to none, One can always have the copy of local git
repo in the dropbox folder, for additional security, Can you not ? :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not have a task
####################&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 2014-03-23
:category: thoughts
:tags: thoughts, advice, startup
:slug: i-do-not-have-a-task&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Showing initiative to help yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start ups are considered (by some) as best opportunity to advance one’s career. Irrespective of your years of experience or previous background, start ups will let you work on variety of tasks without specifying boundary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sad when a start up employee says or thinks “I am done working on what I was asked, and have no next task”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless it is your first day/week, you probably know the pulse of the organization. You also (should) know various projects/products/initiatives being perused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start ups are always short of resources. There is always more work than people available. Show initiative, that is the only way to grow. If you keep expecting “work to be assigned” to you, you are probably not a good fit for a start up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the various things one can do when waiting for formally being assigned the next task ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the bug tracking system :  see which bugs/features you can address and volunteer for those. Even if you do not end up working on it, at least you would have now understood — probably unknown till now — part of the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn new technology : This might be more time consuming, but you should be doing this anyway, probably along with your main assignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make performance improvements : Depending on the time you have till the next assignment, this may or may not be possible. But you can get started ☺&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review code written by  peers. This helps you learn to write better code, also helps you reduce code review comments if any, especially if you are a junior associate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check to see if you can help with non-development related work, and expand your mind by knowing other parts of business. This could be looking at front end code, if you are a back end developer, or vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also try to get involved in non-technical work. Create an internal company newsletter. Try out new tools company can use for collaboration. Update the documentation. Write up suggested updates for the company website and send suggestions to the founders. If the company facebook/twitter account is non-functional or not well utilized, volunteer to run that. (Thanks  Navin Kabra , for suggesting this entire bullet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to learn more about the domain you are working on. This might help you understand implicit requirements in your field of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not restricted to start ups, People should be doing this in any organization, and there are lots of big companies where this is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assumed more “established” companies may have problems when junior person “tries to look around”, on the other hand start ups may welcome it. I’m sure there are exception in either cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to &lt;code&gt;Navin &amp;lt;https://medium.com/@ngkabra&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ and &lt;code&gt;Sushrut &amp;lt;https://medium.com/@iamSB&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ for Reviewing the draft and making this post better.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Information at the fingertips is overrated
##########################################&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 2014-02-07
:category: thoughts
:tags: thoughts
:slug: info-fingertips-overrated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It does not solve world hunger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I think it is overrated ? It is because human beings are lazy by nature. I can probably cite biological reasons like caveman had to conserve energy, do not waste energy on things that can be avoided. But that was probably true in case of physicial work, but guess these lazy genes take over even in the information age&amp;hellip; and I think our genes may not be wrong. Just look at &lt;code&gt;this &amp;lt;https://www.google.co.in/search?q=thinking+burns+more+calories&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is fair to assume that lack of information definitely &lt;em&gt;blocks&lt;/em&gt;, but having the information isn&#39;t the silver bullet either.
I am not talking about the information overload either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the examples of why I think it is overrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I shared password for demo site w/ my boss multiple times via email - Even then, just before the demo he needs to ask the login credentials to me. It was always in his mailbox - but it is easier to ask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a lot of time to write detailed root cause of a problem via email with my team mates. Still we have to have a meeting and discuss (and waste X hours multipled by Y developers ? when reading individually and spending time thinking and efforts to understand by oneself would have been more effective IMO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the product I created :
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers have their &amp;ldquo;TO DO&amp;rdquo; list shown to them when they login, still they need email reminder before the task is due. So we send reminder 15 and 5 days before the task is due. Now their &amp;ldquo;managers&amp;rdquo; need email reminder 2 days before the task is due.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is online report for customers, still they expect the reports to be emailed to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the cases - the lack of information was never a problem, neither was information overload (may be only in case where password was needed to be searched from lot of emails)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;एका सकाळची गोष्ट
###############&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📅 2014-01-16
:tags: marathi, personal
:slug: one-fine-morning
:category: marathi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;काल रात्री झोप कशी ती आलीच नाही, रात्र भर असं‌ जागरण झाल्यामुळे, आज सकाळी मी थोडा रडतच उठलो. पहीले पायावरचं पांघरूण बाजूला केले लाथा मार मारून, बाबा बाजूलाच होते, त्यामुळे मग थोडा थांबलो, काय करावं अशा विचारात होतो, बाजूला माझा आवडता लोड होता, तो घ्यावा असं वाटलं, म्हणून डाव्या कुशीवर वळलो, थोडं अडखळल्या सारखं झालं, मला परत रडू येणार असं वाटायला लागलं, अजून थोडा प्र्यत्न केला, उजवा पाय जोरात लोडाच्या दिशेने टाकला. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;आता बाबा अचानक ओरडू लागले, आईला बोलावू लागले, थोडा वेळ मी काय झालयं, असा विचार केला, मला काही कळेना, असू द्या, काही का असेना. एवढ्यात आजी, आजोबा, आणी आई आले, साधारण पणे, आता आई मला जवळ घेते, पण तिने चक्क mobile phone उचलला . . असो. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;आता पर्यंत मी पोटावर पालथा पडलो होतो, पण डावा हात पोटाखालीच अडकला होता, आता तोन्डातून लाळ गळायला लागली होती, पण हात काही निघेना, मग दोनही पाय पोटाखाली घेतले, मग पोट थोडं उचललं गेलं आणी हात सुटला . . . हुश्श . . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;इतका वेळ लांब उभी राहिलेली आई आता जवळ आली, आईच्या डोळ्यात पाणी होतं, तिने मला उचलून घेतले, आणि म्हणाली, &amp;ldquo;सोना, आज तू मोठ्ठी प्र् गती केलीस, I am so proud of you” मला काही कळलं नाही एवढं काय झालं ते, मला तर लोड घ्यायचा होता, तो तर नाहीच मिळाला, पण पोटावर पडलो ह्याचा ह्यांना एवढा कसला आनंद झालाय ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;नंतर दिवसभर परत प्र् यत्न करून सुद्धा तसं काही जमलं नाहीच, हे लोक उगीच वाट बघत होते.&lt;/p&gt;
